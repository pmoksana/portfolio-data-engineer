### About Me


With 5 years of practical experience as a project manager and Scrum Master in global, multinational teams.
I'm transitioning my career to a technical role as a Data Engineer. I've built my knowledge in SQL, Python, Data science, Linux, networking, AWS services, cloud infrastructure, and problem-solving. My passion lies in data science and analysis.
          

 
### 🚀 Hard Skills & Technical Competencies:

#### **SQL**
* **Experience creating data visualizations in Python, using pandas to process data and Matplotlib to generate charts**



#### **Cloud**
* **AWS Services:** EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, DynamoDB, RDS, CloudTrail, Config, Trusted Advisor
* **DevOps Mindset:** CI/CD concepts, automation, and infrastructure as code (IaC)
* **Tools:** AWS CLI, AWS Systems Manager, Git & GitHub

#### **System & Networking**
* **Linux OS:** Command-line navigation, file permissions, process management, and package management (yum, apt)
* **Networking:** TCP/IP, IP addressing (IPv4), subnetting, CIDR, and network security
* **Databases:** SQL and NoSQL (CRUD operations, schema design)

#### **Programming**
* **Python:** Functions, loops, conditionals, data types

### Soft skils:
* 🔹 Facilitate key Agile ceremonies and guide the team in applying Scrum values, ensuring we’re not just doing Agile, but being Agile
* 🔹 Co-create roadmaps and delivery plans based on team capacity, product goals, and metrics — balancing the short-term sprint rhythm with the big-picture strategy
* 🔹 Write epics, user stories, and requirements that help align dev work with business value
* 🔹 Support the Product Owner in backlog prioritization, refinement, and stakeholder alignment
* 🔹 Foster team connection and psychological safety through regular 1:1s, retrospectives, and open conversations — because delivery follows trust
* 🔹 Track risks, dependencies, and delivery health — and proactively course-correct when needed


📌 What I actually can bring as my past experience of management and Agile transformation:

* 🔸 Create onboarding flows for new engineers that reduced ramp-up time and improved team performance metrics
* 🔸 Establishe a shared understanding of the product vision and roadmap between devs, POs, and stakeholders
* 🔸 Facilitate retrospectives and feedback loops to help teams reflect and continuously evolve and improve sprint-over-sprint
