        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Data Engineer candidate, transitioning from 5+ years of success as a Project Manager and Scrum Master for global teams. 
            This unique blend of experience allows me to approach data projects not just from a technical perspective, but with a deep understanding of end-to-end delivery, team coordination, and dependency management. 
           
        </p>

            </p>
      <p>
           My background ensures that data solutions are not only technically sound but also delivered on time, within budget, and perfectly aligned with business goals.
  

        <h3 class="section-title">Core Technical Competencies:</h3>
        
    

        <ul>
            <li>Programming: Python for ETL scripting (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).</li>
            <li>Data Storage/Querying: Expert SQL (optimized queries, stored procedures, window functions) and experienced with various databases (e.g., Postgres, MySQL).</li>
            <li>Cloud & Infrastructure: Hands-on experience building and deploying data services within AWS (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda, Glue, CloudFormation) and comfortable working within Linux environments for administration and monitoring.</li>
            <li>Value Proposition: I translate business requirements into user stories and high-performance data deliverables, effectively bridging the gap between business vision and tech team.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
            I'm now seeking my next Data Engineer role where I can apply my skills to build robust, scalable data solutions, accelerating Data Science and analytical initiatives.
